# About

Pringles logo detection in images using only classical methods.

# Help:

[Here](./HELP.md) or
```sh
python ./main.py --help
```

# Run

Image size will heavily impact processing speed as well as detection results.
Bigger size will not always result in better detection.

```sh
python ./main.py ./input output
```
